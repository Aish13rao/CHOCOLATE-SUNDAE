STEP 1: Chop the chocolate up into small pieces. Add the cream and chopped chocolate into a small pot on the stove and put on a low heat.

STEP 2: Sift the cocoa and add to the pot with golden syrup. Stir well really well. If you are having trouble getting lumps of cocoa out you may need to blitz it briefly using an immersion blender.

STEP 3:Add the brown sugar, vanilla essence and butter. Stir well and cook for another five to ten minutes or until sauce starts to thicken and is smooth and glossy. To test if the sauce is has thickened enough put a small spoonful into a small bowl and put in the freezer for a few minuits.

STEP 4:Transfer to a heat proof container and either use immedatly or store in a airtight container in the fridge until needed.

STEP 5: The sauce will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks, but I doubt it will last that long! If the sauce is to thick to pour when you take it out of the fridge you can microwave it in a microwave proof container VERY briefly. Like for five seconds.
